<h2>Our Initiative</h2>

		<p>
		India has great economic potential as it is one of the youngest populations in the world. As the rest of the world ages,
		 India becomes more youthful.In India,About 50% of children do not attend school. This can be attributed to the high poverty rate in the country and in 
		 many cases the low priority given to Education.
		93 million people in India are slum-dwellers, many of which are children. These children will most likely never see the 
		inside of a classroom, they are destined to remain uneducated like their parents. The children who are fortunate enough to
		 live out of the slums but who are still impoverished are taught from an early age not to make education a priority. Many 
		 families prefer the children to start working and supporting the family as soon as possible. They do not see worth in paying
		 the price(small as it is) for a Government school when they can get their children to start earning money.
		</p>
		<p>
            Two sisters, now long retired, always had a desire to teach such underprivileged children. Promilla Gupta and Dipti Mithal decided to visit an orphanage to inquire about the children&#39s educational opportunities. In 2001, they visited Ramanuja 			Vaish
             Orphanage in Meerut, India and started their quest to change lives.First thing they did was to train the girls and the boys above 18 for the post of nurse ,beautician, driver etc. and made them self-reliant and independent.
             This is how the main objective of YES was somewhat fulfilled to empower the children through employment .

		</p>
		<p>
            In the orphanage, they set up 4 tables and 4 benches for a total of 90 children (40 girls and 50 boys) and taught them every 
            day for 2 years.
             They hired highly qualified teachers and organized all the students by aptitude levels.
		</p>
		<p>
            Ms. Gupta and Ms. Mithal&#39s scope went far beyond just teaching. In addition to schoolwork, they engaged the children in
             outdoor games to encourage physical activity and healthy socialization.
		</p>
		<p>
            The Orphanage manager feared reallocation of power and forbade further involvement.
            But the sisters didn&#39t give up and in 2002, they rented out a house to teach the children. The children who desired to learn
             more would come to the house after their school ended every day. This continued for almost one year.In this school even the 
             Director&#39s grandchild was enrolled.
		</p>

		<p>
            In late May 2002, they started a school in a small village called Partapur, in Meerut. There were 2 male teachers and
             one of them had himself been taught at the orphanage two years ago. They taught 70 children each year for 3 years.Another 
             branch of this school was opened up in Uttarakand.
		</p>
		<p>
            In June of 2004, they opened a school in Shastri Nagar, Meerut. They invited all the kids, up to 9 years old, from the 
            slums and other impoverish areas around the school. For the first time, kids attended the school who had no previous education
             whatsoever. When the school first opened, children came who were very unhygienic and not bathroom trained. The teachers would 
             sometimes help bathe them before they started studying.

		<h2>What We Do</h2></br>
		<p>

            Rajwanti Public Academy holds 80 students and 6 teachers in a small building located in Meerut, India. The school is 
            completely free for the students and many of them come from neighbouring slum areas. Few live in developed areas with houses 
            and urban amenities. 
		</p>
		<p>
            The children are taught Science, Math, and English five hours a day for six days a week.There is one computer in the school, and the kids take turns learning on it.Frequently, teachers hold an interactive session with students with the help of IPads which makes learning interesting.
		</p>
		<p>
            In addition to schoolwork, the children engage in outdoor activities such as badminton, racing, cricket, and long jump. 
            They are taken to the University Area by Auto Rickshaw to play in the field a few times a week.
		</p>
		<p>
            The school goes up to 5th class, and then the kids are sent to a Meerut public school or Ambedkar school directly for higher education if they choose
             to continue with their education.
		</p>
		<p>
            One of the members of this graduating class just passed 12th class in a Meerut public school. He is now taking a test for
             Information Technology college in Saket.

		<p>
            The local free school in Meerut, UP, teaches kids up to the 6th grade. The teachers at the school have a meager salary and are 			not working for the money but rather the fulfillment received from helping these poor children. The children are provided with 			books, stationary, and notebooks from the school - something uncommon to other schools in the area. One grateful young student 			says, "My dad sells ice cream and doesn't have money to educate me but because of this school, I am able to study." Another 			young boy told reporters, "My dad does cleaning work and wasn't planning on educating me. If I hadn't come to this school, I 			would have never learned to read and write."
		</p>

            <h5><b>Article Published in Dainik Jagran on April 22, 2010 </b></h5><br/>
		<p>
            ​ This school is working for the betterment of society- as society gets more educated, many things will fall into place. 		Metropolitan cities have a higher literacy rate and are cleaner and more civilized- poor urban areas will follow suit as they 			receive more education. These kids, by attending this school, not only are receiving a basic education, but are understanding 			their civic duties and will be ideal citizens. In 2010, there were 124 children in the school, and a ratio of 30 students to 1 			teacher. In other schools, the ratio is commonly 90 children to 1 teacher. Due to the greater one on one attention and much 			perseverance of the principal and teachers- this school has an excellent curriculum and the graduates are as well prepared as 			private school students. </p>

		<p>A big thanks to our generous anonymous donor who has donated to us $6000 this year. This will help us get into a larger space, enable promotion for the teachers and hopefully reach out to more kids and improve their lives. 
Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
