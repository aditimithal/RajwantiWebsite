<p>Most of the kids who attended the free schools were destined to be uneducated their entire life. The best jobs they would 
		find would be in masonry-laying stones, marbles, and doing tile work as well as fixing mobile phones part time. These jobs 
		have minimal pay and few workers can be financially independent and comfortably support a family.  With these free schools, 
		children have an incentive to educate themselves. Through higher education, they can pursue better jobs with a more reliable
		 and stable pay. These are the students who decided to pursue higher education after being inspired by the free school.
